# ABCU
The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU decided it is time to write the code for the program that department advisors will use to talk to students. In this program, a user is greeted with a menu. Here, the user can choose to load data structure, see the course list, see the prerequisites for a course, or exit the program.

- **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU requested me to create the pseudocode and the code for a program that would be used between the academic advisors and students. I was asked to ensure that the program printed a menu with options students could choose from such as list of courses or the prerequisites that each course had. 

- **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

When approaching the problem of creating a program for the academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU, I followed a systematic approach to ensure the solution met the requirements effectively. First, I began by analyzing and understanding the requirements given to me by the academic advisors. For example, some of the functionalities that they wanted me to include in the program were displaying a menu with options for the students, or showing prerequisites for each class. Next, based on the requirements given to me, I designed a user-friendly menu that was easy to use and navigate. This included, for example, creating the different options with easy wording to make it easy to understand. Then, when creating the code, I had to ensure I chose the appropriate data structure. The choice of the right data structure is crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of any program. For my program, I chose to use an associative array that mapped keys to values. This allowed me for efficient lookup based on the various keys. Finally, I implemented the functionality for the various menu options using the right algorithms. For example, when a student enters the option number to look at the different classes that are offered, the program retrieves a list of courses from the data structure and displays it accordingly. 

Overall, understanding data structures is crucial in this process due to efficiency, organization, and functionality. Choosing the right data structure can significantly impact the performance of the program. Additionally, data structures help in organizing and managing daya in a structured manner, making it easy to access and use the information as needed. Last, different data structures offer different functionalities. Understanding the characteristics of each data structure can help me choose the one that suits me best based on the requirements of the program. 

- **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

In order to overcome any roadblocks, first I had to understand the problem that was presented to me. Once I had a better idea of what I was expected to do, I used the resources and tips given to me by my professor. These resources and tips helped me have a better understanding of what I was doing wrong and what I could change to fix the problem. At times, I had to also take breaks in order to put my thoughts together. When I was not able to fix the problem right away, this is one of the approaches that helped me the most as it helped me cool down. Then, when creating the code, I used the debugging tools given to me by eclipse in order to identify and resolve errors that would arise in the code. Finally, I stayed persistent. Despite the many challenges I encountered, I never gave up. Using these strategies and keeping a positive mindset helped me approach and fix the problems that I encountered during the development of the program. 

- **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

My work on this project has expended my approach to designing software and developing programs in several ways. Through my work, I learned to prioritize user experience by designing intuitive interfaces and consider the needs of the academic advisors in the department of Computer Science at ABCU and the students. Also, understanding the requirements given to me by my clients and their feedback has become a crucial aspect in the process of designing these interfaces. Additionally, embracing an agile development methodology has become very important to my approach. Iteratively refining the solution based on my client's feedback and adapting myself to changing requirements has been a significant aspect of this project. Finally, throughout the project I encountered roadblocks that I had to overcome. These problems sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me to approach challenges with a systematic mindset, breaking them down into manageable parts and using any available resources to find solutions. 

Overall, working on this project broadened my perspective on software design and development, emphasizing the importance of modular architecture, efficient algorithms, and agile methodologies.

# ABCU
The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU decided it is time to write the code for the program that department advisors will use to talk to students. In this program, a user is greeted with a menu. Here, the user can choose to load data structure, see the course list, see the prerequisites for a course, or exit the program.

- **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU requested me to create the pseudocode and the code for a program that would be used between the academic advisors and students. I was asked to ensure that the program printed a menu with options students could choose from such as list of courses or the prerequisites that each course had. 
- **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

- **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**


- **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**


- **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
